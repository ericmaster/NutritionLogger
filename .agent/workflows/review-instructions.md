description: Load project instructions and architecture documentation
---

This workflow loads the comprehensive project documentation into context.

1. Read the main instructions file:
   - View `INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the project root
   - This contains complete architecture, setup, and development guidelines

2. The instructions cover:
   - Project structure and file organization
   - Application architecture (App, Delegate, MenuDelegate, View)
   - State machine flow (Idle → Recording → Paused)
   - Button mappings for all states
   - FIT file integration and custom fields
   - Sensor configuration
   - Development setup and testing
   - Code conventions and style guide
   - Extension guidelines

3. Use this workflow at the start of any development session to refresh context on the project structure and conventions.
